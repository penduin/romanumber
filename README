javascript polyfill to parse/stringify roman numerals


this super-useful polyfill lets you do incredibly relevant and meaningful
things with numbers in javascript, like this:

  var num = 5;
  console.log(num.toString("r")); // logs "V"

  console.log(parseInt("IX"));    // logs 9


just as you've always dreamed, you can now use a radix of "r" or "R" to
parse and stringify roman numerals.  parseInt even auto-detects.

you're welcome, humanity!
