javascript polyfill to parse/stringify roman numerals


this super-useful polyfill lets you do incredibly relevant and meaningful
things with numbers in javascript, like this:

  var num = 5;
  console.log(num.toString("r"));  // logs "V"

  var str = "IX";
  console.log(parseInt(str, "r")); // logs 9


just as you've always dreamed, you can now use a radix of "r" or "R" to
parse and stringify roman numerals.  you're welcome, humanity!
